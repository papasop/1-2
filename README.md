## ðŸ§  Overview

This project presents a new structural interpretation of the **Riemann Hypothesis**, combining:

- Self-conjugate symmetry of the zeta function on the critical line  
- Phase convergence dynamics  
- High-order derivative stability  
- Shannon entropy analysis of phase derivatives

We provide both **theoretical insight** and **numerical evidence** that the line $\Re(s) = \tfrac{1}{2}$ acts as a **dynamic attractor** in the complex plane, minimizing structural perturbations in the phase of $\zeta(s)$.

## ðŸ“„ Paper Summary

ðŸ“Œ **Title**: *Phase-Locking and Minimal Entropy at â„œ(s) = 1/2: A Dynamic Approach to the Riemann Hypothesis*  
ðŸ§® **Core Idea**:  
The critical line is not just analytically special â€” it is structurally optimal. Phase derivatives exhibit:

- **Minimal standard deviation**
- **Minimal Shannon entropy**
- **High symmetry and dynamic stability**

This supports the hypothesis that $\sigma=1/2$ is the only location of global phase equilibrium.

## ðŸ§ª Numerical Validation

We compute the third derivative of the unwrapped phase function:
\[
\theta'''(t) = \frac{d^3}{dt^3} \arg(\zeta(\sigma + i t))
\]

We test:
- $\sigma = 0.49999$
- $\sigma = 0.50000$
- $\sigma = 0.50001$

**Results:**

| Ïƒ        | Std(Î¸''') | Shannon Entropy |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| 0.49999  | 184.27     | 1.183            |
| 0.50000  | **160.12** | **1.052**        |
| 0.50001  | 184.56     | 1.183            |

âœ… **Minimal entropy and fluctuation occur exactly at Ïƒ = 0.5**  
ðŸŽ¯ This suggests a structural "locking" mechanism for nontrivial zeros.
